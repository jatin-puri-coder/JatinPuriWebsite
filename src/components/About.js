        <p>Iâ€™m a highly motivated individual who has a great ability to adapt to new people and environments as well as welcoming new experiences. I am a people-person and I love to meet and interact with individuals from different backgrounds and cultures. I have always had a keen interest in technology and web development. After creating a couple of websites using web builders and knowing nothing about coding to becoming a full stack web developer after 15 weeks is something that I am very proud of. I am very excited and looking forward to continue learning and growing as a developer.</p>
